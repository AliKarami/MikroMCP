## [Unreleased]

### Security
- `allowedToolPatterns` in `identities.yaml` used prefix-only matching: it took the text before the first `*`, so a pattern like `*_wifi` had an empty prefix and silently allowed **every** tool. Matching now uses a proper anchored glob, so leading/mid-string wildcards (`*_wifi`, `manage_*_rule`) behave correctly.
- `run_command`'s deny-list guard was trivially bypassable: it matched patterns against the raw command string, so ROS7 slash-path syntax (`/system/reboot`), whitespace/case variation, command chaining (`:put 1; /system reboot`), and `:execute`/`:parse` indirection all slipped past. The guard now normalizes each command (path and space separators treated equally) and checks every `;`/newline-separated segment; `:execute`/`:parse` are denied by default. Documented explicitly as best-effort defense-in-depth, not an authorization boundary.
- TLS certificate fingerprint pinning (`tls.fingerprint` in `routers.yaml`) was a silent no-op: it was enforced via `tls.checkServerIdentity`, which Node ignores when `rejectUnauthorized` is false — exactly the self-signed setup the docs recommend pinning for. Pinning is now enforced in the connection layer (post-handshake `fingerprint256` check that destroys the socket on mismatch), so it holds regardless of `rejectUnauthorized`.

### Fixed
- `rollback_change`/snapshots are substantially safer: snapshots now store only restorable configuration (dynamic router-generated records excluded, runtime/counter fields like `bytes`/`packets`/`rx-byte`/uptime stripped), so counters no longer produce spurious diffs and read-only fields are never written back and rejected mid-restore. Semantic-key diffing falls back to whole-record matching when the key is not unique within a side (e.g. multiple uncommented firewall rules that previously collapsed to one and scheduled the rest for deletion). Order-sensitive paths (firewall filter/nat/mangle, routing rules) now emit a warning that rule order is not restored, and deleted users are never recreated (passwords aren't in snapshots) — a warning is returned instead.
- HTTP request bodies and SSH command output are now decoded once over the full byte stream instead of per chunk, so multi-byte UTF-8 characters split across chunk boundaries are no longer corrupted into replacement characters.
- SSH command timeouts (`run_command`, inline `export_config`) now reject with an `ETIMEDOUT` error instead of silently resolving with partial (or empty) output as if the command had succeeded — the command may still be running on the router, so the caller is told to verify.
- Maintenance windows spanning midnight (e.g. `22:00`–`02:00`) never matched, so destructive operations were blocked around the clock on routers configured with an overnight window. Overnight windows are now supported: `days` names the day the window opens and the window wraps past midnight into the following day.
- Boolean record fields (`disabled`, `running`, `dynamic`, `active`, …) are parsed into real JS booleans by the REST client, but several idempotency checks compared them against the string `"true"` — which is always false — so `enable` actions on `manage_scheduled_job`, `manage_firewall_rule`, `manage_mangle_rule`, `manage_routing_rule`/`manage_routing_table`, `manage_package`, and the `manage_ip_address` add idempotency check silently reported "no change" without applying anything. All boolean-field comparisons now go through a shared `isTrue()` helper. `RouterOSRecord` values are now typed `string | number | boolean` to reflect the parser's output.
- Numeric parsing kept 64-bit RouterOS counters (e.g. `rx-byte` above 2^53) as JS numbers, silently losing precision. Unsafe integers now stay strings.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- `list_routers` tool — read-only enumeration of the routers configured in `routers.yaml` (id, host, port, TLS status, tags, ROS version, and which is the default), so MCP clients can discover valid `routerId` values and tags for targeting other tools (including `bulk_execute`) without opening the config file. Reflects local config only — no RouterOS API call and no credentials in the response; results are scoped to the caller's `allowedRouters` ([#53](https://github.com/AliKarami/MikroMCP/issues/53))

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- `get_log`'s `sinceMinutes` filter now recognises RouterOS full-date timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`), which routers use for entries older than the current day. Previously these timestamps were unparseable and kept regardless of the time window, so `sinceMinutes` appeared to have no effect on logs spanning multiple days ([#45](https://github.com/AliKarami/MikroMCP/issues/45))
- `get_log`'s `sinceMinutes` window is now measured against the router's own clock instead of the MikroMCP host clock. When the host and router were in different timezones, the window was offset by the difference; the tool now reads `system/clock` (only when `sinceMinutes` is set) and falls back to the host clock if it is unavailable
- All 44 `list_*` tools now serialize their rows into the human-readable `content` field (one compact `key=value` line per record) instead of returning only a summary count. Clients that render only `content` (not `structuredContent`) previously saw no itemized data — e.g. `list_firewall_rules` returned "Full records in structuredContent." with no rows. `structuredContent` still carries the full untruncated records ([#46](https://github.com/AliKarami/MikroMCP/issues/46))

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- `MIKROMCP_DEFAULT_ROUTER` environment variable — sets the router used when a tool call omits `routerId`
- MikroMCP usage skill (`skills/mikromcp/`) — a progressive-disclosure Claude Code skill for driving the tools safely (tool selection, dry-run/confirm/rollback flows, fleet ops, error recovery) with curated links to official MikroTik documentation. See `docs/wiki/Using-the-Skill.md`.
- MCP server now sends a concise `instructions` string in the initialize response (safety nudge: dry-run writes, confirmation tokens, prefer dedicated tools over `run_command`) so any client gets baseline guidance even without the usage skill

### Changed
- `routerId` is now optional on every router-scoped tool. When omitted, the server resolves it from `MIKROMCP_DEFAULT_ROUTER`, or the sole configured router when exactly one exists; otherwise it returns a `MISSING_ROUTER_ID` error listing available routers
- Slimmed the advertised tool catalog (`tools/list`) by reusing shared schema-field definitions and tightening the longest tool descriptions — roughly 14% fewer tokens per catalog with no change to tool behaviour
- List tools now return a concise summary in their text `content`; full per-item detail remains in `structuredContent`, avoiding duplicate payloads across both result fields
- `mikromcp init` now prompts whether to set the configured router as the default (`MIKROMCP_DEFAULT_ROUTER`), writes it into `.env` accordingly (active when accepted, commented-out otherwise), shows the choice in the summary, and points to the usage skill in its next-steps
- `mikromcp doctor` now validates default-router resolution (errors if `MIKROMCP_DEFAULT_ROUTER` names an unknown router, notes the implicit sole-router default, warns when multiple routers have no default) and checks whether the usage skill is installed
- Internal: extracted a shared `paginate()` helper for client-side pagination, a shared `toolError()` handler-error wrapper, and made the circuit breaker `state` getter side-effect-free (the open→half-open transition is now explicit). No user-facing behaviour change.

### Fixed
- Audit log redaction now recurses into arrays, so secrets nested in step arrays (e.g. `apply_plan` / `bulk_execute` step params) are stripped instead of leaking
- `manage_firewall_rule` idempotency now compares `src-address`, `dst-address`, and `protocol` in addition to chain/action/ports — previously rules differing only by address or protocol were treated as identical (returned `already_exists`) instead of raising a `CONFLICT`
- `bulk_execute` now takes config snapshots and writes journal entries for destructive sub-operations, matching single-router write tools (enables rollback of fleet changes)

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- `manage_dns_settings` tool — write upstream servers, cache TTL, allow-remote-requests
- `delete_file` tool — delete a file from the router filesystem by name
- `manage_ipsec_policy` tool — add/remove/enable/disable IPSec policies
- `manage_wireguard_interface` tool — add/remove/enable/disable WireGuard interfaces
- `get_container_config` tool — read global container registry/RAM/veth config
- `manage_container_config` tool — write global container config settings
- `list_container_envs` tool — list container environment variable entries
- `manage_container_env` tool — add/remove container environment variables
- `list_container_mounts` tool — list container volume mount definitions
- `manage_container_mount` tool — add/remove container volume mounts
- `bandwidth_test` tool — run RouterOS bandwidth test to a remote btest server
- `fetch_url` tool — send HTTP/HTTPS request from the router using /tool/fetch
- `list_connections` tool — list active firewall connection tracking entries
- `list_interface_lists` tool — list all interface lists
- `manage_interface_list` tool — add/remove interface lists
- `manage_interface_list_member` tool — add/remove interfaces from interface lists
- `list_ppp_profiles` tool — list PPP profiles including built-in defaults
- `manage_ppp_profile` tool — add/update/remove PPP profiles

### Fixed
- `fetch_url` — RouterOS requires `http-method` in lowercase; uppercase values (`GET`/`POST`) were rejected with HTTP 400
- `fetch_url` — added `output=user` for inline body response; fixed file-save mode to use `output=file` + `dst-path` (was incorrectly setting `output=<filepath>`)
- `fetch_url` — RouterOS `/tool/fetch` returns a streaming array of progress sections; handler now finds the `finished` section and reads `code` (HTTP status) and `data` (body) from it

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `list_user_groups` — list local user groups with policy bitmask (`/user/group`)
- `manage_user_group` — create, update, or remove user groups; idempotent by name; update action changes the policy string
- `get_upgrade_status` — check RouterOS and routerboard firmware upgrade availability and current channel
- `manage_upgrade` — trigger a package update check (`action=check`) or install an upgrade (`action=install`, destructive, reboots)
- `create_backup` — create a binary router config backup file with optional encryption password

- `manage_log_rule` — add, remove, enable, or disable log rules; idempotent by topics+action composite key
- `list_log_actions` — list log action targets (memory, disk, remote syslog, etc.) with type filter

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `list_pppoe_clients` — list PPPoE client interfaces with connection state; filters by parent interface and status (connected/disconnected/all); supports pagination
- `manage_pppoe_client` — add, update, or remove PPPoE client interfaces (idempotent by name+interface+user for add; no_change guard on update; password always written when provided since RouterOS does not expose it in GET)
- `list_ovpn_clients` — list OpenVPN client interfaces with connection state and remote endpoint; supports pagination
- `manage_ovpn_client` — add, update, or remove OpenVPN client interfaces (idempotent by name+connectTo for add; no_change guard on update; certificate and credential references)
- `get_ovpn_server` — read OpenVPN server configuration (port, mode, protocol, certificate, cipher, auth, enabled state)
- `manage_ovpn_server` — enable/disable the OpenVPN server or update its configuration (port, mode, protocol, certificate, cipher, auth); enable/disable are idempotent; set returns no_change when all fields already match

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- `manage_vlan` — add, remove, enable, or disable VLAN interfaces (idempotent by name; supersedes `create_vlan`)
- `list_ip_pools`, `manage_ip_pool` — IP address pool tools (renamed from `list_dhcp_pools`/`manage_dhcp_pool`; pools serve any subsystem, not only DHCP)
- `manage_dhcp_lease` — convert dynamic DHCP leases to static or remove leases (idempotent by MAC address; make-static is a no-op when lease is already static)
- `list_dhcp_clients`, `manage_dhcp_client` — DHCP client configuration per interface (which interfaces obtain IP via DHCP)
- `list_ip_services`, `manage_ip_service` — view and enable/disable RouterOS IP services (api, api-ssl, ssh, telnet, www, www-ssl, winbox, ftp; port changes excluded to prevent lockout)

### Changed
- `list_dhcp_leases` gains `leaseType` filter (`dynamic`, `static`, `all`) to distinguish lease types
- `list_dhcp_servers` gains `offset` parameter for consistent pagination across all list tools

### Removed
- `create_vlan` — replaced by `manage_vlan` which covers the full interface lifecycle
- `list_dhcp_pools`, `manage_dhcp_pool` — renamed to `list_ip_pools`, `manage_ip_pool`

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `GET /healthz` endpoint on the HTTP transport for container liveness/readiness probes (unauthenticated, not rate-limited).
- `GET /metrics` Prometheus endpoint exposing per-tool call counters (`mikromcp_tool_calls_total`).
- `bulk_execute` can now fan out destructive tools when given a fleet confirmation token (two-step HMAC flow; requires `MIKROMCP_CONFIRMATION_SECRET`).
- `MIKROMCP_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) — config snapshots older than this are pruned at server startup.
- Expanded snapshot semantic keys so `rollback_change` produces in-place updates (instead of delete-then-create) for certificates, files, VRRP, DHCP servers, IPSec peers, IP pools, simple queues, netwatch entries, and users.

### Changed
- Server version is derived from `package.json` (generated `src/version.ts`) instead of a hardcoded string.
- Snapshot, write-journal, and audit-log file writes are now asynchronous (non-blocking).

### Fixed
- Read tools now retry on transient HTTP 5xx / timeout / busy responses (the retry engine previously honoured only raw network errors).
- Circuit breaker half-open state now admits a single recovery probe at a time.
- `apply_plan` records real per-step duration in the write journal, and its sub-steps now run through the per-router circuit breaker so a plan fails fast against a router known to be down.
- Audit log and write journal now redact VPN/crypto secrets (WireGuard private keys, IPSec PSK, SNMP community strings).
- `MIKROMCP_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` set via `~/.mikromcp/.env` now activates the audit file sink (it was read before dotenv loaded and silently ignored).
- HTTP rate-limiter no longer leaks memory — stale per-IP windows are swept periodically.
- The pooled RouterOS REST client is now evicted after a router authentication failure.
- `bulk_execute` fleet operations are now written to the audit log (previously produced no audit trail).
- `mikromcp init` now writes empty `allowedRouters`/`allowedToolPatterns` (the documented "all" sentinel) instead of `["*"]`, which silently denied access to every router.

### Removed
- Unused `pagination` configuration block.

---

## [1.0.10] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- MCP Registry name casing corrected to `io.github.AliKarami/mikromcp` (was lowercase, causing 403 on publish).
- MCP Registry description trimmed to satisfy 100-character validation limit.

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- MCP Registry metadata and GitHub Actions publishing via `mcp-publisher` OIDC.

### Changed
- Add npm `mcpName` ownership marker for `io.github.alikarami/mikromcp`.

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Suppress dotenv v17 stdout output in stdio transport (dotenv 17 writes to stdout on load, which corrupted the JSON-RPC stream)

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- `mikromcp init`: default router port to 80, set `rejectUnauthorized: false`, quote YAML string values to prevent parse errors

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- `mikromcp init`: overwrite `.env` instead of appending when re-running; warn upfront if config files already exist

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- `mikromcp update` CLI command — self-updates the installed package via npm

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- `mikromcp init`: add transport selection prompt; collect and write router credentials to `.env`

### Changed
- README quick-start rewritten for the `npm install / init / doctor` workflow

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Default all config paths to `~/.mikromcp/` for consistent behaviour across install methods

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Remove unused `platform` import and stray `data` parameter; add `lint` + `typecheck` to `npm test`

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Bundle all dependencies for pkg binary and stub `node:sqlite`; use separate tsup config for pkg binaries to avoid native-addon conflicts
